i made a version of klondike solitaire already (not that it's good), so i should be able to make shenzhen solitaire without many issues
hopefully i can help refine my use of sdl, at least on a basic level
maybe i can do some game jams over the summer using it?
plus i can add everything i make to the website

i'll probably document this one *much* more thoroughly than the first one i made
maybe i could expand it with other solitaire games later?
who knows

i'll probably start with the same boilerplate as last time (~ish)
then i'll move on to setting up "zones"
unlike last time, these won't have a specific position tied to them from the beginning
i'll give them a bunch of modifiable constants than only really matter when drawing and getting input
later on, those can be changed during runtime based on window size and etc

next i'll set up all the logic and restrictions
i can just test these out with some ugly placeholders

then i'll get to graphics (ewwwww)
the cards will probably need to look better than last time
i need to get used to that aspect too
i'll pick a more palatable color palette, create my own symbols (to an extent)
i kind of want it to be minimalist
we'll see how it ends up working out

mmmmenus
i don't like them
but i'll figure out how to make some
it'll probably start out ugly for the first draft

after all of that
i'll try and lock it down, put it on the website
and then revise

i want a snapshot after i finish because 
a) it seems like i accomplished something
b) it might(?) show growth
c) i feel like i'll appreciate it down the road

speaking of
i need to work on my website
like a lot
and then the ftc team's
and then the frc team's

so i'll be doing that over the summer too
i'll work on my palette

and names!
i need to settle on a few for english
i've been using one for a while but it's kind of mid
nikeja and waso awen can only go so far

i'll be fine though
nice to write some
i'll probably add this to the lipu soon (i haven't written in like weeks)

wow
i've been working on this almost all day now (i took breaks obv)
umm
i made graphics for all the cards (i might add a flower symbol into the flower cell later) and got all the rendering stuff working
i should be done friday (6/2/23) which is nice
i still haven't written in the lipu
next week i should be free and alone, so i'll probably write then
i think the cards look *significantly* better than they did for the other solitaire game
if this ends up polished enough i'll put it on my website
and then actually work on my website (and then the teams')

i've been learning unlws!
it's ... weird
stack constructions still confuse me a bit
i wrote a text in it though, and sai & alex went through it (i got <parent> backwards)

the first thing i need to write in the lipu is a ginormous summary
like of the year, event, media, all of it
and i also need to document all the series i've seen (and am seeing)
mmmmmm
